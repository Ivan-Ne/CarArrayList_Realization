# CarArrayList_Realization
This task is about creating a car registration system, which uses fields brand(brand of car) and number(number of car).
To solve this task I created 2 classes: Car and CarArrayList, Interface CarList and made the tests in CarListTest.
The car registration system has 6 methods: get, add, remove, removeAt, size and clear.

See the code and method's description at the attached files.
